# Airline_Predictions

This project was built for Big Data Access and Management course at Indiana University. The purpose of the project was to implement a portion of a data pipeline from ingesting through to transformation techniques and dropping into gold container on the datalake.

I had not built a data pipeline before so this was a difficult project to implement and had a high learning curve. The main deliverable was the Final Project Report. I also add the Documentation Guide that shows additional screenshots of what services were used and how they were implemented.
